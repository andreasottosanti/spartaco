`spartaco` implements a novel statistical approach for detecting spatially expressed genes in sub-groups of spots in spatial transcriptomic experiments. Details of the statistical model appear in the article *Co-clustering of Spatially Resolved Transcriptomic Data* by A. Sottosanti and D. Risso available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04872).

## Installation instructions
